# Getting help

The SuperBOL Studio OSS extension for Visual Studio Code is brought to you by the SuperBOL team (https://superbol.eu/) at OCamlPro (https://ocamlpro.com/).
The goal of SuperBOL, in general, is to provide a complete open-source environment for COBOL programs to migrate to, based on the GnuCOBOL free and open-source compiler.

## SuperBOL Studio OSS

If you encounter any issue with this extension, do not hesitate to:

- post [an issue](https://github.com/OCamlPro/superbol-studio-oss/issues/);

- ask questions in the #superbol stream at https://chat.ocamlpro.com/.

## GnuCOBOL

The people at https://superbol.eu/ also contribute to GnuCOBOL, which is the tool that is used by the extension to compile and execute your COBOL programs.

## Commercial Support

If you are a heavy user of SuperBOL and/or GnuCOBOL, we can provide commercial support to you and your teams.
Commercial support can be as simple as replying to questions on how to better benefit from the tool features, or fixing simple bugs.
We can also provide evolutive support, i.e. adding new features to SuperBOL or GnuCOBOL.
