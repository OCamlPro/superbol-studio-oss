main.exe env
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generate commands to set environment variables to use the specified switch



**DESCRIPTION**


This command generates a list of command to set environment variables for an existing switch.

It is usually used as:
::

  # eval $(superbol env)
  # cobc --version


The **--switch SWITCH** option can be used to choose a different switch from the default one. SWITCH should match a sub-string of a switch name. **--last** can be used to select the most recent switch.

The **--global** option can be used to generate a file **$HOME/.config/superbol/env** that can be loaded from shell init scripts, using a symlink to point PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the current switch at any time. Changing the current switch will then automatically redirect cobc to that new switch.


**ABOUT SWITCHES**


Switches are used to easily handle multiple GnuCOBOL installations. The section **[switches]** in the user configuration file **$HOME/.config/superbol/config.toml** contains several variables:

* * 'dir'
  The directory where installations should be performed, and switches imported from.

* * 'current'
  The current switch name to use by default

* * 'list'
  The list of known switches, with the corresponding installation directory

* * 'num'
  A counter used to name switches

Switches can be created, imported and used using the following commands:

* **superbol env [SWITCH] [--last] [--global]**
  Output a list of shell commands to set the environment variables to use a specific switch

* **superbol import [DIRS] [--clear] [--no-set]**
  Scan directories to detect GnuCOBOL installations, and created associated switches

* **superbol add DIR [--switch SWITCH] [--no-set]**
  Add a specific GnuCOBOL installation directory as a switch

* **superbol build [DIR] [--sudo] [--switch SWITCH] [--no-set]**
  From inside GnuCOBOL sources, configure, build and install and add the corresponding switch

* **superbol list**
  List known switches

* **superbol set [SWITCH] [--last]**
  Set the current default switch

**USAGE**

**DESCRIPTION**


This command can be used to snapshot the environment when a command is called, typically in a test script, to be able to run this command in the same environment from outside the script.

A snapshot typically contains:

* * **cmd**
  The command to run with its arguments

* * **pwd**
  The directory where the command should be run

* * **env**
  The environment variables for the command

Snapshots are stored in **$HOME/.config/superbol/snapshots**.


**SNAPSHOT CREATION**


To snapshot a command, use:
::

  # mname tname --save SNAP_ID -- cmd args


The previous command will create a snapshot **SNAP_ID**, and then run the command **cmd args**.

You can use **--quit** if you don't want to run the command at all (the command will exit with status 2)


**SNAPSHOT USAGE**


To run a command in a previously created snapshot, use:
::

  # mname tname --load SNAP_ID -- cmd args


The previous command will load the snapshot **SNAP_ID**, go to its directory, set the environment and then run the command **cmd args**.

If **cmd args** is empty, then the snapshot command is run.

The argument **--no-cd** can be used to run the command in the current directory.

The argument **--env VAR=VALUE** can be used to add an extra variable to the environment, after the one set by the snapshot.

If a **cmd args** is provided, the following special items are substituted:

* * **__**
  is replaced by all the arguments (including the command) from the snapshot

* * **_0**
  is replaced by the command from the snapshot

* * **_1**
  is replaced by all the arguments (excluding the commnad) from the snapshot

For example:
::

  # mname tname --load ID -- gdb _0 --args __


will run the command inside **gdb** with its arguments as provided by the snapshot.

**USAGE**
::
  
  main.exe snapshot ARGS [OPTIONS]

Where options are:


* :code:`ARGS`   Command line arguments

* :code:`--env VAR=VALUE`   Set a variable in the environment

* :code:`--load ID`   Load snapshot ID

* :code:`--no-cd`   Do not change directory to run the command

* :code:`--quit`   Do not run the command, just exit

* :code:`--save ID`   Create snapshot ID from state
