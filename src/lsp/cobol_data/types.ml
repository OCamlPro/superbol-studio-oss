    Such a representation would be much more general than what typical COBOL
    data definitions allow; in particular, one could have "shifted" redefintions
    of any non-01 group item.

    However, we keep the distinction between RENAMES and REDEFINES to better
    match said typical COBOL, and possibly allow more detailed error
    reporting. *)
