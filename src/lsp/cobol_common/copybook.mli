(** [find_lib ~lookup_config ?fromfile ?libname txtname] attempts to locate a
    file containing the copybook [txtname], which is a file named [txtname],
    possibly appended with an extension from [libexts] (considered in order), {e
    unless} [txtname] is given as an alphanumeric literal ({i e.g, [txtname =
    `Alphanum filname] --- in which case no extension is assumed).

    If [libname] is not provided, then the file is searched within the
    directories listed in [libpath] (considered in order).  Otherwise, a single
    directory [libname] is considered; if [libname] is a relative path, it is
    interpreted relative to the directory that contains [fromfile].

    Lookup is performed in a case-insensitive way. Every directory in the path
    is considered in order, and all extensions are tried for a given directory
    of the path in the provided order.
